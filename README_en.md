# Welcome to my Full Stack 4.0 Repository!

In collaboration with the Argentine government and Egg Cooperation, the Argentina Programa 4.0 course comes to life. In this repository, you'll find comprehensive guides, challenging exercises, and my own solutions.

Note: All the documentation and excercises is in Spanish.

- [Section 1: Introduction to Programming](#section-1)
- [Section 2: BackEnd 1: Java](#section-2)
- [Section 3: BackEnd 2: Java and Databases](#section-3)
- [Section 4: FrontEnd](#section-4)
- [JavaScript Guide Exercise Showcase](#javascript-guide-exercises)
- [Full Stack Junior Course Certificates, Egg Cooperation](#certificates)

You'll encounter a wide range of languages and technologies, such as Java, JavaScript, and SQL. Including pseudocode to build a solid foundation in programming logic using the PseInt tool.

From the basics of web development with HTML and CSS to mastering essential frameworks like Bootstrap for creating appealing interfaces. We also delve into advanced technologies like React, enabling you to build modern and powerful web applications.

This repository represents the core of my education. Following this guide, I've learned, practiced, and grown my ability to create comprehensive technological solutions.
